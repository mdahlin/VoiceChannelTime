# Voice Channel Time Discord Bot

Code for a discord bot that tracks time spent in voice channels and reports a leaderboard of time spent by user in minutes. After setting up the bot on a server, the bot will track time spent in any voice channel (leaderboard is updated for each user every time the leave the voice channel). The leaderboard can accessed by typing `$leaderboard` in any text channel.

*Note: if set up on multiple discord servers, the current implementation will result in the leaderboard being shared between all of them*
